This is not an original product, this is a fork of `PloneGazette`__.

__ http://plone.org/products/plonegazette

Motivation
==========

**(...also know as: "why branching?"...)**

For a very long long time PloneGazette development has been stopped, and we continued a
non-official set of changes.

After a long long time the official development re-started, but our branch is **so** different that a
merge was mostly impossible. But we like our changes!

Please note
===========

This product is compatible with PloneGazette *but* you can't use both together (they use the same namespace!).

Dependencies
============

This product has been tested on all Plone versions from 3.3 to 4.3.
